# Analysez les ventes d'une librairie avec R ou Python

## Sc√©nario

As a data dnalyst responsible for analyzing online sales data at Lapage, a large and very reputable online generalist bookstore, I have the following mission:

- Analyse the different sales indicators;

- A more customer-targeted analysis: the objective would be to understand the behavior of our customers online, in order to then be able to compare with the knowledge acquired via our physical bookstores.
