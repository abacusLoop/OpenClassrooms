## Scénario

You are a Data Analyst consultant in a company specializing in data. Your company has obtained a management service within the National Organization for the Fight against Counterfeiting (ONCFM).

This institution aims to put in place methods for identifying counterfeit euro banknotes. They therefore call on you, a data specialist, to set up a model that would be able to automatically identify the real ones from the fake ones. And this simply from certain dimensions of the banknote and the elements that compose it.
