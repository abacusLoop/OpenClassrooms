# Optimisez la gestion des données d'une boutique avec R ou Python

## Scénario

As a data analyst at BottleNeck, a very prestigious wine merchant, I have the following mission:

- Bring together two exports: an export from the ERP containing the product references, their selling price and their stock status, and an export from a table from the CMS tool containing the information of the products marketed online (name, description , number of sales...).

- Have the turnover by product, as well as the total turnover made online.

- Check whether there have been any input errors in certain product prices: perform an analysis on this variable in order to detect possible outliers, list them and make a graphical representation of them for more readability.
