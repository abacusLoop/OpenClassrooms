# Réalisez une étude de santé publique avec R ou Python

## Scénario

As a data analyst in a team of researchers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) I have to give an overview of the state of malnutrition in the world, by answering the questions: 

- the proportion of people in a state of undernutrition;

- the theoretical number of people who could be fed;

- the same goes for the food availability of plant products;

- the use of domestic availability, in particular the part that is allocated to animal feed, the part that is lost and the part that is actually used for human food. 

Any additional idea is welcome.
