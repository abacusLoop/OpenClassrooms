# Analysez des indicateurs de l'égalité femme-homme avec Knime

## Scénario

Every year before March 1, companies with at least 50 employees must calculate and publish their gender equality index on their website. 

As a data analyst in an entreprise I have to automate the creation of a diagnostic report on gender equality in the workplace using KNIMW. 

The final result of the analysis is a KNIME workflow, clean data and a set of graphs which are used to explain the position of women and men in the company.
